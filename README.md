# IDEA9103-Major-Coding-Project - 'cosmic colliderScope'

'cosmic colliderScope' is a generative code artwork exploring the emergent properties of agent based systems.
From simple rule sets running over many iterations, complex structures and ecosystems of 'agents' are seen to move through space, colliding, dying and giving birth to replica versions of themselves.
A cosmic drama unfolds across a two dimension cartesian plane whereby agents follow their trajectory until they interact with one another or fall into orbit around wormholes, leaving intricate spirograph-like mandalas in their wake.
'cosmic colliderScope' is an exercise built on mathematical functions, conditional logic, and select applications of random chance. When combined, these rules produce surprising unscripted events, where one agent's rules interacts with another or their environment.
The outcome of these elements shows how coded instructions and mathematical principals hold the potential to mirror systems found in the natural world, and the overlapping artistic potential therein for works of creative design.
